# Vocabulary Builder
This Android application, written in Java and Kotlin, lets the user collect and practice translations in different language pairs.
The user can select the foreign language and the target language (e.g. Spanish -> English), and can add translations either manually or by scanning a text. 
This way, the user can learn vocabulary from 0, and can easily track wheter a text contains word that are not yet in his/her vocabulary. 
This app uses a translation API, as well as the android camera API and a library for scanning texts. 
The collected translations can be practiced. The level of mastery of each translation is stored in persitent data in a local database using SQLite.
